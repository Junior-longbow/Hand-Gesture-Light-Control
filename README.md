# Hand-Gesture-Light-Control
This project enables a light to be controlled by simple hand gestures, using an Arduino-compatible board (WeMos D1 R2) and a relay module. A tracking sensor detects hand movements to turn a connected light on or off, creating a touchless and intuitive lighting control system.
